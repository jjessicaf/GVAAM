Beginning of the hours of the Holy Cross.
Divine Lord, open my lips. 
And my mouth 
shall announce 
your praise. God, come to my assistance. 
O Lord, haste to help me. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, 
and to the Holy Ghost. Even as it was 
in the beginning, and now, and ever: 
and world without end, Amen.
The wisdom of the Father, and divine truth, 
God made man 
was captured at the morning hour, by His
disciples quickly abandoned: by the Jews
betrayed, sold, and tormented.
Verse: We adore you O Christ, and we bl[ess you]
/next/
[We bl]ess you, for by your holy 
cross you have redeemed the world.
O Lord Jesus Christ, son of the living God, 
set your passion, cross, 
and death between your judgment 
and my soul, now, and 
in death and vouchsafe to grant unto me 
mercy and grace, to the living and 
the dead rest and pardon, to your church 
peace and concord, and to us sinners life and glory 
everlasting. You who live 
and reign forever and ever. Amen. At Prime.
O God, [come] to assistance.
At the hour of prime, Jesus is led 
to Pilate. Much accused by false witnesses. On the neck,  
/next/
they strike him with his hands tied, 
they spit upon God’s face, 
the dear light of heaven. Verse: We adore you. Prayer: 
Lord Jesus Christ. At Terce.
O God, [come] to assistance. Hymn. 
“Crucify him,” they scream 
at the third hour. The one they mock is clothed 
with a red robe, his head is pricked 
with a crown of thorns, he carries the cross 
on his shoulders to the place of pain. 
Verse: We adore you. Prayer: Lord Jesus Christ. 
At [Sexte].
O God, [come] to assistance. Sexte. 
At the sixth hour of the day, Jesus was nailed to the cross 
and, sentenced, with thieves, 
he is left hanging. Thirsty for the tortures, 
filled with bitter poison, the lamb 
washed away crime made divine in such way. Verse: We adore you. 
Prayer: O Jesus Christ. At Nones.
