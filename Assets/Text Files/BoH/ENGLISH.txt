Divine Lord, open my lips. 
And my mouth

your praise. God, come to my assistance. 
O Lord, haste to help me. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, 
and to the Holy Ghost. Even as it was 
in the beginning, and now, and ever: 
and world without end, Amen.
The wisdom of the Father, and divine truth, 
God made man 
was captured at the morning hour, by His
disciples quickly abandoned: by the Jews
betrayed, sold, and tormented.
Verse: We adore you O Christ, and we bl[ess you]

cross you have redeemed the world.
O Lord Jesus Christ, son of the living God, 
set your passion, cross,

and my soul, now, and 
in death and vouchsafe to grant unto me 
mercy and grace, to the living and 
the dead rest and pardon, to your church 
peace and concord, and to us sinners life and glory 
everlasting. You who live 
and reign forever and ever. Amen. At Prime.
O God, [come] to assistance.
At the hour of prime, Jesus is led 
to Pilate. Much accused by false witnesses. On the neck,

they spit upon Godâ€™s face, 
the dear light of heaven. Verse: We adore you. Prayer: 
Lord Jesus Christ. At Terce.
O God, [come] to assistance. Hymn. 
â€œCrucify him,â€ they scream 
at the third hour. The one they mock is clothed 
with a red robe, his head is pricked 
with a crown of thorns, he carries the cross 
on his shoulders to the place of pain. 
Verse: We adore you. Prayer: Lord Jesus Christ. 
At [Sexte].
O God, [come] to assistance. Sexte. 
At the sixth hour of the day, Jesus was nailed to the cross 
and, sentenced, with thieves, 
he is left hanging. Thirsty for the tortures, 
filled with bitter poison, the lamb 
washed away crime made divine in such way. Verse: We adore you.

God, come to my assistance. In the beginning
At the ninth hour, Jesus died, 
crying â€œEli,â€ he commended his spirit 
to his father. His side was pierced 
By a soldier with a spear, then the earth 
trembled and the sun darkened. 
Verse: We adore you. Prayer: O Lord Jesus.
God, come to my assistance. At Vespers
 


He is taken down from the Cross at the hour of Vespers.
Strength hid itself in the divine 
mind. The medicine of life suffered 
such a death. Alas, the crown of glory 
lay supine. Verse: We adore
you. Prayer: O Lord Jesus Christ. At Compline
Convert us, O God, our saviour,
and turn your anger 
away from us. O God, come 
to my assistance.

/next/ #Fol. 10r
At the hour of Compline, he was laid in the tomb; 
the noble body of Christ, 
the hope of future life is embalmed with spices. 
The Scriptures are fulfilled. 
May this death be perpetually in my memory.
Verse: We adore you. Prayer: O Lord Jesus. Hymn.
These hours canonical with 
devotion to you Christ, I honor 
with godly intention, in the fervor of your love that you 
have suffered for me, so laboring 
is a harmony fellow without a crown.

And I will go unto the

gives joy 
to my youth. Deign,
O Lord, to keep us
from sin this day. 
O give thanks unto the Lord, 
for he is gracious: 
because his mercy endureth forever.
I confess to God of heaven, and the blessed
Virgin Mary, and to all of 
his saints, and to our Father, because I, 
A wretched sinner, have sinned 
against the law of God too much in thought,
speech, judgment, sight, word, 
and deed, through my fault, through my fault,
through my most grievous fault. Therefore, I ask

the most blessed Virgin Mary and 
all male and female saints of God: and you,
our Father, pray for me, sinner.
May almighty God have mercy on you,
and forgiving all 
your sins, bring us and you, 
Jesus Christ, without stain of sin, 
with joy to everlasting life. Amen.   
Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us 
but to your name give glory. Cleanse
me of my hidden sins, O Lord,
and spare your servant from foreign sins. O 
Lord, show us your mercy
and grant us your salvation. Pray
for us, holy Mother of God, that 
we may be made worthy of the promises
of Christ. O Lord, hear my prayer
and let my crying come

Hail, Holy Mother, who
in childbirth brought forth the King
who rules heaven and earth, world without end.

assistance. Glory be to the Father.

God, Lamb of God, Son of the Father, that
takes away the sins of the world, have mercy upon

sit at the right hand of the Father, have mercy
on us. For you alone are ho-
ly, you alone are the Lord. You alone are most high
Jesus Christ. With the Holy 
Spirit, in the glory of God the Father. Amen. 
Grant, we beseech you, 
O Lord God, that we your servants,

From the beginning and before    of Wisdom
the ages were created and unto

in honorable people, 
and in the portion of my God his inheritance, 
and mine abode is 
in the full assembly of the saints.

Said: Nay, rather, blessed are those
who hear the word of God, and keep
it. Thanks to God.
I believe in one God, the Father
Almighty, maker of heaven and 

/next/ #Fol. 19r
earth, of all things visible and 
invisible. And in one Lord
Jesus Christ, the only begotten son 
of God, begotten of the Father 
before all ages. God of God, light
of light, true God of true 
God, begotten, not made, consubstantial
with the Father, by whom all things
were made. Who, for us men,
and for our salvation
came down from heaven, and was
incarnate by the Holy Spirit of
the Virgin Mary, and was made man.
He was crucified also for us, suffered under
Pontius Pilate, and was buried: 
and the third day, he arose again, according to
the scriptures, and ascendit into heaven.
He sits at the right hand of the Father: and he shall  

/next/ #Fol. 19v
come again with glory, to judge
the living and the dead: and his kingdom shall
have no end. And in the Holy Spirit,
the Lord, and giver of life, who 
proceeds from the Father to the Son, Who together with 
the Father and the Son, is adored and 
glorified: Who spoke by the
prophets. And one, holy, catholic,
and apostolic Church. I confess
one baptism for the remission
of sins. And I expect the resurrection
of the dead, and the life 
of the world to come. Amen. Offertory: For you are 
happy, o Holy Virgin Mary, and are worthy
of all praise, for out of you 
arose the sun of justice, Christ our 
God. Through all ages of 
ages. The Lord be with you.   

/next/ #Fol. 20r  
And with your spirit. Hearts aloft,
we have, to the Lord. Let us give
thanks to the Lord, our God.
It is right and just. Holy,
holy, holy Lord 
God of Hosts. Heaven and earth 
are full of your glory, hosanna in the highest.  
Blessed is He who comes in the name
of the Lord, hosanna in the highest. Forever
and ever. Amen.
And do not lead us into temptation,
but free us from evil. Amen.
Forever and ever.
Amen. The peace of the Lord be with you always
and with your spirit. Lamb 
of God, who takes away the sins of the world,
have mercy on us. Lamb of God, who
who takes away the sins of the world, have mercy 

/next/ #Fol. 20v
on us. Lamb of God, who takes away 
the sins of the world, grant us peace.
After After [sic] Blessed is the womb of the Virgin
Mary, that bore the son 
Of the everlasting Father, O Lord, hear my prayer. Prayer:
Pour forth, we beseech you, O Lord,
your grace into our hearts;
that we to whom the incarnation
of Christ, your son, was made known by the message of an angel,
may by his passion and cross,
Be brought to the glory of his resurrection.  Through 
The same Christ our Lord. Amen.
Beginning of the Holy Gospel according
to John. Glory to you, Lord.
In the beginning was the word,
and the word was with God,
And the word was God. The same

/next/ #Fol. 21r
was in the beginning with God. All
things were made by Him, and without Him 
was made nothing that was made:
in Him was life, and the life was 
the light of men; and the Light shines in darkness, 
and the darkness did not comprehend it.
There was a man sent from God, 
whose name was John. This man came 
for a witness, to give testimony 
of the light, that all men 
might believe through him. He was not 
the light, but was to give testimony 
of the light. That was the true light, 
which enlightens every man that 
comes into this world. He was 
in the world, and the world was made by Him,
and the world knew Him not. He came unto His own, and His own 

/next/ #Fol. 21v
received Him not. But as many as
received Him, He gave them power
to be made the sons of of God, to them
that believe in His name, who are born not of 
blood, nor of the will of the man but of God. And the word
was made flesh, and dwelt among 
us: and we saw His glory, 
the glory as it were the Only begotten of the Father,
full of grace and truth. Thanks to God. Gospel of Luke
At that time, the Angel Gabriel 
was sent by God into a city of 
Galilee, called Nazareth, 
to a virgin espoused 
to a man whose name was Joseph, of the 
house of David: and the virgin's name was 
Mary. And the Angel being entered in, 

/next/ #Fol. 22r
said unto her, Hail full of Grace, our Lord 
is with thee: blessed art thou among women.
Who having heard, was troubled at 
his saying, and thought what manner 
of salutation this should be. And the Angel said
to her, Fear not Mary, for thou 
has found grace with God. 
Behold thou shalt conceive, and shalt bear a son: 
and thou shalt call his name Jesus. 
He shall be great, and shall be called the son of the most High, and our Lord God shall give him the seat of David his father: 
and he shall reign in the house of Jacob 
forever, and of his kingdom there shall be 
no end. And Mary said to the Angel, 
How shall this be done: because 
I know not man? And the Angel answering, 
said to her, The holy Ghost 

/next/ #Fol. 22v
shall come upon thee, and the power of the most high 
shall overshadow thee. And therefore 
also that which of thee shall be born Holy, 
shall be called the son of God. And behold Eliza-
Beth, your cousin, she also has conceived 
a son in her old age: and 
this month, is the sixth to her that is 
called barren: because there shall not be 
impossible with God any 
word. And Mary said: 
Behold the handmaid of our Lord, be it done to me according to thy word. Gospel of
At that time,                                                                                                    Matthew
when Jesus was born in 
Bethlehem of Judah in the days of Herod 
the King, behold, there came sages from the East 
to Jerusalem, saying: 
Where is he that is born King of the Jews? 

/next/ #Fol. 23r
For we have seen his star in the East, 
and we come to adore him. And Herod the King 
hearing this, was troubled, 
and all Jerusalem with him. 
And when he had gathered 
All the chief priests 
and scribes of the people together, he inquired of
them where the Christ was to be born. So 
they said to him: For thus it is written
by the prophet, and you, Bethlehem, land of Judah,
are not the least among the rulers 
of Judah; for out of you shall come a ruler,
Who will shepherd my people Israel. 
Then Herod, when he had secretly called the wise 
Man, determined from them what time 
The star appeared; and 
he sent them to Bethlehem and said:
Go and search carefully for

/next/ #Fol. 23v
the young child; and when you have found him, bring back word
to me, that I may come and worship him. 
When they heard the king, they 
Departed. And behold the star, which they had seen
in the East, went before them, til 
it came and stood over the Lord,
where the young child was. When they saw the star,
they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.   
And when they had come into the 
House, they saw the young child with Mary his
mother and fell down and worship
Him. And when they had opened His treasures, they
offered Him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh. And having been warned in a dream 
by the angel not to return to Herod, 
they left by another road 
for their own country. Gospel of Mark
Afterward the Lord Jesus

/next/ #Fol. 24r
Appeared to the eleven disciples: he upbraided them 
for their lack of faith 
and stubbornness, because they had not 
believed those who saw him after 
he had risen. And he said to them, â€œGo 
into all the world and proclaim the good news
to all the creatures. The one who 
believes and is baptized 
will be saved, but the one who does not believe 
will be condemned. And these signs 
will accompany those who believe. 
By using my name they will cast out demons; 
they will speak in new tongues; they will pick up 
snakes, and if they drink any 
deadly thing, it will not hurt them; 
they will lay their hands on the sick, 
and they will recover. So then the Lord Jesus, 
after he had spoken to them, was taken up

/next/ #Fol. 24v
into heaven and sat down at the right hand 
of God. And they went out and proclaimed 
the good news everywhere, while the Lord worked 
with them and confirmed the message
by the signs that accompanied it. Thanks to God.

Come let us rejoice unto our Lord, 
let us make joy to God our saviour: let us 
approach to his presence in 
confession, and in psalms let us make joy 
unto him. Hail Mary: our Lord is with you. For God is a great Lord,

and a great king 
above all gods: because our Lord does not repel 
his people: for that in his hand 
are all the bounds of the earth, and he beholds 
the heights of the mountains. Our Lord 
is with you. For the sea is his, 
and he made it: and his hands founded 
the dry land: come let us adore,

before our Lord, that made us: 
because he is the Lord

Whom earth, and sea, and eke the skies,

a maiden's inward parts bear,
bedewed with celestial grace.
Blessed is the mother by this gift,

whose womb as in a coffer held, the maker that surmounts all,
who in his hand the world doth weld. Glory

Blessed are you                         Psalm
O Lord our Lord: how marvelous 
is your name in 
the whole earth. For your magnificence 
is lifted up: above the heavens. Out of the mouth of 
infants and sucklings you have perfected 
praise because of your enemies: 
that you may destroy the enemy, and 
revenger. For I shall behold your heavens 
the works of your fingers: 
the moon and the stars, which you have founded.
What is man, that you are mindful 
of him: or the son of man, that 

/next/ #Fol. 28r
you do visit him? You have made him 
a little lower than angels, with glory and ho-
nor, you have crowned him: and set 
him over the works of your hands.
You have put all things in subjection
under his feet: all sheep and oxen: 
moreover the beasts also of the fields.
The birds of the air, and the fishes of the sea, 
that pass through the paths of the 
sea. O Lord our Lord, how 
admirable is your name 
in all the earth! Glory be to the Father. Antiphon.
Blessed are you among women, and 
blessed is the fruit of your womb. Antiphon.
Even as myrrh. Psalm

uttereth word: and night unto night 
shows knowledge. There are no languages, 
nor speeches: whose voices are not 
heard. Their sound has gone forth 
into all the earth: and unto 
the ends of the round world the words of them. In the sun,
he has put his tabernacle: and himself 
as a bridegroom coming forth 
of his bridechamber. He has rejoiced as a giant 
to run the way: his coming forth is
from the highest heaven. And his recourse 
even to the top thereof: neither is there any 
that can hide himself from his heat. The law 
of our Lord is immaculate converting 
souls: the testimony of our Lord is faithful, 
giving wisdom to little ones. The justices 
of our Lord be right, making hearts 
joyful: the precept of our Lord is lightsome 

/next/ #Fol. 29r
illuminating the eyes. The fear 
of our Lord is holy, permanent for ever 
and ever: the judgments of our Lord be true, justified 
in themselves. To be desired 
above gold, and stone much precious: 
and more sweet above honey, and 
the honeycomb. For your servant 
keeps them: in keeping them is much 
reward. Sins who understands? from my secret sins 
cleanse me, God: and from other men's spare 
your servant. If they shall not have dominion 
over me, then shall I be immaculate: and shall be 
cleansed from the greatest sin. And 
the words of my mouth shall be such as may 
please: and the meditation of my heart 
always in your fight. O Lord my 
helper: and redeemer. Glory

The earth is our Lord's, 
and the fulness thereof: the round world and all that 
dwell therein. Because he 
has founded it upon the seas: 
and upon the floods has prepared it.
Who shall ascend into the hill of 
our Lord: or who shall stand 
in his holy place? The innocent of hands, 
and of clean heart, that has not taken 
his soul in vain: nor 
sworn to his neighbor in guile. He 
shall receive blessing of our Lord: 
and mercy of God his saviour. This 
is the generation of them that seek him: 
of them that seek the face of the God of Jacob.

The sting of death being overcome:

You sit at the right hand of God: in

Blessed be our Lord God of Israel: 
because he has visited and wrought the 
redemption of his people. And hash erected 
the horn of salvation to us: in the house 
of David his servant. As he spake 
by the mouth of his holy prophets: that are from the beginning.
Salvation from our enemies: and from the 
hand of all that hate us.
To work mercy with 
our fathers: and to remember 
his holy testament. The oath, 
which he swore to Abraham 
our father: that he would give to 
us. That without fear being delivered 


/next/ #Fol. 39v
from the hand of our enemies: we may 
serve him. In holiness and justice 
before him: all our 
days. And you child, shall be called 
the prophet of the highest: for you shall go 
before the face of our Lord, to prepare 
his ways. To give knowledge 
of salvation to his people: unto remission 
of their sins. Through the bowels 
of the mercy of our God in which the orient 
from on high, has visited us. To illuminate 
him that sit in darkness, and in 
the shadow of death: to direct 
our feet into the way of peace.
Glory be to the Father. Antiphon: O blessed Mary mother of God, 
perpetual virgin, temple

holpen with you. Through the same 
Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
Antiphon: O all ye saints of God vouchsafe

Incline unto my

Glory be to the Father. Hymn.
Be mindful author of our health, that 
you sometime did take on you
of a pure virgin being born,
the form of our humanity. Mary that mother 
art of grace, of mercy mother also art, save 
and defend us from our foe, receive us when we hence depart.
Glory be unto you O Lord, that born 
was of the virgin pure, with the father and 
the holy Ghost, all ages ever to endure. 
Amen. Antiphon: Ascended est. Psalm:
O God save me in your 
name: and in your strength judge 
me. O God hear my prayer: 

/next/ #Fol. 41v
with your ears receive the words of my 
Mouth. Because strangers have risen up 
against me, and the strong have 
sought my soul: and they have not 
set God before their sight.
For behold God 
helped me: and our Lord is the receiver 
of my soul. Turn away the evils 
to mine enemies and in your truth 
destroy them. I will voluntarily sacrifice 
to you: and will confess to your name 
O Lord, because it is good. Because 
you have delivered me out of all tribulation: 
and my eye has looked down 
upon my enemies. Psalm:
O Lord you have blessed your land: 
you have turned away the captivity of 
Jacob. You have forgiven the iniquity 

/next/ #Fol. 42r
of your people: you have covered all their 
sins. You have mitigated all your 
wrath: you have turned away from the wrath 
of your indignation. Convert us o God 
our savior: and avert your wrath 
from us. Will you be wroth 
with us forever: or will you extend 
your wrath from generation to 
generation? O God you being turned 
shall quicken us: and your people 
shall rejoice in you. Show us 
O Lord your mercy: and give us 
your salvation. I will hear 
what our Lord God will speak in me: 
because he will speak peace 
unto his people. And upon his saints: 
and upon them, that are converted 
to the heart. But yet 

/next/ #Fol. 42v
his salvation is nigh to them that fear him: that 
glory may inhabit our land.
Mercy, and truth have met 
each other: justice, and peace have kissed.
Truth is risen out of the earth: and justice 
has looked down from heaven. For 
our Lord truly will give benignity: and our land 
shall give her fruit. Justice 
shall walk before him: and 
shall set his steps in the way.
Praise our Lord all ye gentiles: 
praise him all ye people.
Because his mercy is confirmed 
upon us: and his truth 
remains forever. Glory be to the Father.

tongue? The sharp arrows of the 
mighty: with coals of desolation.
Woe is unto me, that my sojourning

I have lifted up my eyes unto the mountains: 
from whence help shall come

which made heaven and earth.
Let him not give your foot

Our Lord keeps you, our Lord

Let our Lord keep your coming in,

I rejoiced in those things, which 
were said to me: we shall go into the house 
of our Lord. Our feet 
were standing: in your courts O Jerusalem.
Jerusalem which is built 
as a city: whose participation therefore 
is in itself. For thither did 
the tribes ascend, the tribes of our Lord, 
the testimony of Israel: to confess 
unto the name of our Lord. Because 
seats sat there in judgment: seats 
upon the house of David. Ask ye 
the things that are for the peace of Jerusalem: 
and abundance to them that love 
you. Peace be made in your strength: and 

/next/ #Fol. 45v

For my brethren, and my neighbours' 
sakes: I spake peace of 
you. For the house of the Lord our 
God: I have sought good things to you. Glory be

To you have I lifted up my eyes: 
which dwell in the heavens. Behold 
as the eyes of servants: are in the hands 
of their masters. 
As the eyes of the handmaid in the hands 
of her mistress: so are our eyes 
to the Lord our God, until 
he has mercy on us. Lord 
have mercy upon us, have mercy upon us: 
because we are much replenished with 
contempt. Because our soul 

/next/ #Fol. 47v
is much replenished: reproach 
to them that abound, and contempt 
to the proud. Psalm.
But that our Lord was in us, 
let Israel now say: but that our Lord 
was in us. When men rose up 
against us: perhaps they had 
swallowed us alive. When their fury 
was angry against us: perhaps 
water had swallowed us. Our soul 
has passed through a brook: 
perhaps our soul had passed through 
an intolerable water.
Blessed be our Lord: which has not given 
us for a prey to their teeth.
Our soul as a sparrow 
is delivered: from the snare of the fowlers.
The snare is broken: and we 

/next/ #Fol. 48r
are delivered. Our help 
is in the name of the Lord, 
who made heaven and earth. Psalm:
They that trust in our Lord, 
as mount Sion: he shall not 
be moved for ever, that dwells
in Jerusalem. Mountains 
round about it, and our Lord round 
about his people: from henceforth, now, 
and for ever. Because our Lord 
will not leave the rod of sinners 
upon the lot of the just: 
that the just extend not their hands 
to iniquity. Do well 
o Lord to the good: and right of heart.
But those that decline into bonds, 
our Lord shall bring with them 
that work iniquity: peace

shall keep the city: he watches in vain, 
that keeps it. It is in vain 
for you to rise before light: rise ye,

deposed the mighty from their seat: and has exalted 
the humble. The hungry he has filled 
with good things: and the rich he has sent away 
empty. He has received Israel his child:

exceedingly: but you Lord how long?
Turn you O Lord, and deliver 
my soul: save me 
for your  mercy. Because 
there is not in death, that is mindful 
of you: and in hell who shall 
confess to you? I have laboured 
in my mourning, I will every night 


/next/ #Fol. 62v
wash my bed: 
I will water my couch with tears.
My eye is troubled for fury: 
I have waxen old among all 
my enemies. Depart from me all ye, 
that work iniquity: because 
our Lord has heard the voice 
of my weeping. Our Lord has heard 
my petition: our Lord has received 
my prayer. Let all my enemies be ashamed, and 
very sore troubled: 
let them be converted, and 
ashamed very speedily. Psalm:
Blessed are they whose 
iniquities are forgiven: and whose sins 
be covered. Blessed is the man to whom 
our Lord has not imputed sin: neither is 
there guile in his spirit.
Because I held 

/next/ #Fol. 63r
my peace, my bones are waxen old: whilst 
I cried all the day. Because day, and 
night your hand is made heavy upon 
me: I am turned in my 
anguish, whilst the thorn is fastened.
I have made my sin known to you: 
and my injustice I have not 
hid. I said, I will confess against 
me my injustice to our Lord: and 
you have forgiven the impiety of my 
sin. For this shall every holy one 
pray to you: in time convenient.
But yet in the overflow of many 
waters: they shall not approach 
to him. You are my refuge 
from tribulation, which has compassed me: 
my joy, deliver me from them 
that compass me. I will give you understanding, 

/next/ #Fol. 63v
and will instruct thee in the way, 
that you shalt go: I will fasten my 
eyes upon you. Do not become as 
horse and mule: who have no 
understanding. In bit and bridle 
bind fast their jaws that 
approach not to you. Many 
are the scourges of a sinner: but mercy 
shall compass him that hopes 
in our Lord. Be joyful in our Lord, 
and rejoice ye just: and glory 
all ye right of heart. Psalm:
Lord rebuke me not in your 
fury: nor chastise me 
in your wrath. Because your arrows 
are fastened in me: and you have confirmed 
your hand upon me. There is no 
health in my flesh in respect 

/next/ #Fol. 64r
of your wrath: my bones have no peace 
in respect of my sins. Because
my iniquities are gone 
over my head: and as a heavy 
burden are become heavy upon me.
My scars are putrified, and corrupted: 
in respect of my foolishness.
I am become miserable, and am made crooked, 
even to the end: I went sorrowful 
all the day. Because my loins 
are filled with illusions: 
and there is no health in my flesh.
I am afflicted, and am humbled 
exceedingly: I roared for the groaning 
of my heart. Lord before you is all 
my desire: and my groaning 
is not hidden from you.
My heart is troubled, 

/next/ #Fol. 64v
my strength hath forsaken me: and the 
light of my eyes, and the same 
is not with me. My friends, and 
my neighbors: have approached, 
and stood against me. And 
they that were near me, stood far 
off: and they did violence, which sought 
my soul. And they 
that sought out evils against me, spake 
vanities: and devised guiles 
all the day. But I as 
deaf did not hear: and as 
one dumb not opening his mouth.
And I became as a man not 
hearing: and not having reprehensions
 in his mouth. Because in you O Lord 
have I hoped: you shall hear me O Lord 
my God. For I have said, lest sometimes 

/next/ #Fol. 65r
my enemies rejoice over me: 
and whilst my feet are moved, 
they spake great things upon me. Because
I am ready for scourges: and my sorrow 
is in my sight always.
Because I will declare my 
iniquity: and I will think for my sin.
But my enemies live, and 
are confirmed over me: and they are 
multiplied that hate me unjustly.
They that repay evil things for good, 
did backbite me: because I followed 
goodness. Forsake me not 
O Lord my God: depart not 
from me. Incline unto my 
help: O Lord God of my salvation. Psalm:
Have mercy on me O God: according 
to your great mercy.

/next/ #Fol. 65v
And according to the multitude 
of your tender mercies: blot out 
my iniquity. Wash me more from 
my iniquity: and cleanse me from 
my sin. Because I know my iniquity: 
and my sin 
is always against me. To you only 
have I sinned, and have done evil before you: 
that you may be justified in your words, 
and may overcome when thou art judged. For 
behold I was conceived in iniquities: 
and my mother conceived me 
in sins. For behold you have loved truth: 
the uncertain and hidden things 
of your wisdom you have made manifest to me.
You shall sprinkle me with hyssop, and 
I shall be cleansed: you shall wash me, and 
I shall be made whiter than snow. To my hearing 

/next/ #Fol. 66r
you shall give joy, and gladness: and humbled 
bones shall rejoice. Turn away 
your face from my sins: and blot out all 
my iniquities. Create a clean 
heart in me O God: and renew a right spirit 
in my 
bowels. Cast me not away from your face: and 
your holy spirit take not 
from me. Render unto me the joy 
of your salvation: and confirm me 
with a principal spirit. I will teach the unjust 
your ways: and the impious shall be converted 
unto you. Deliver me from bloods 
O God, the God of my salvation: and 
my tongue shall extol your 
justice. You O Lord will open my lips: and 
my mouth shall declare your 
praise. Because if you would have had sacrifice, 

/next/ #Fol. 66v
I had verily given it: with burnt 
offerings you will not be 
delighted. A sacrifice to God is a troubled 
spirit: a contrite, and 
humble heart O God, you will not despise.
Deal favorably O Lord, in your good 
will with Sion: and let the walls 
of Jerusalem be built up. Then shall you accept 
sacrifice of justice, oblations, 
and whole burnt offerings: then shall they lay 
calves upon your altar. Psalm:
O Lord hear my prayer: 
and let my cry come to you.
Turn not away your face from me: 
in what day soever I am in tribulation, incline 
your ear to me. In what 
day soever I shall call upon you: 
hear me speedily. For my days 
have vanished as smoke: and my bones 

/next/ #Fol. 67r
are withered as a dry burnt thing.
I am smitten as grass, and my heart 
is withered: for I forgot 
to eat my bread. From the voice 
of any groaning: my bone has cleaved 
to my flesh. I have become 
like a pelican of the wilderness: I have become 
as a night crow in the house. I have 
watched: and have become as a sparrow 
solitary in the housetop. All the day 
did mine enemies upbraid me: 
and they that praised me, swear 
against me. For I did eat 
ashes as bread,
 and mingled my drink with 
weeping. At the face of the wrath of your indignation: 
for that lifting me up you have thrown me down.
My days have declined as a shadow: 

/next/ #Fol. 67v
and I am withered as grass. But 
you O Lord endurest for 
ever: and your memorial in generation 
and generation. You 
rising up shalt have mercy on Sion: 
for it is time to have mercy on it, for 
the time has come. Because the stones 
thereof have pleased your servants: and they 
shall have pity on the earth thereof. And the Gentiles 
shall fear your name O Lord: and all 
the kings of the earth your glory. For 
our Lord has built Sion: and he shall 
be seen in his glory. He has had respect 
to the prayer of the humble: and he has not despised 
their petition. Let these things be written in 
another generation: and the people that 
shall be created, shall praise our Lord. Because 
he has looked forth from his high holy place: our 

/next/ #Fol. 68r
Lord from heaven has looked upon the earth.
That he might hear the groanings 
of the fettered: that he might unbind the children 
of them that are slain. That they may show forth the name of our Lord 
in Sion: and his praise in 
Jerusalem. In the assembling 
of the people together in one: and kings to serve 
our Lord. He answered them 
in the way of his strength: show me 
the fewness of my days. Call 
me not away in the half of my 
days: your years are unto generation, and 
generation. In the beginning O Lord 
you did found the earth: and the heavens are the works 
of your hands. They shall perish 
but you remainest: and they shall all 
wax old as a garment. And 
as a vesture you shall change them, 

/next/ #Fol. 68v
and they shall be changed: but you are the 
selfsame, and your years shall not fail.
The sons of your servants shall 
inhabit: and their seed shall be directed 
for ever. Psalmus: 
From the depths I have cried to 
you O Lord: Lord hear my 
voice. Let your ears be 
attentive: unto the voice of my 
petition. If you will observe iniquities 
O Lord: Lord who shall 
endure it? Because with you there is 
pitifulness: and for your law 
I have expected you O Lord. My soul 
has stayed in his word: my soul 
has hoped in our Lord.
From the morning watch even until 
night: let Israel hope in our Lord.

/next/ #Fol. 69r
Because with our Lord there is mercy: 
and with him plentiful redemption. And 
he shall redeem Israel: from all 
his iniquities. Psalm:
Lord hear my prayer, with 
your ears receive my petition: 
in your truth, hear me in your 
justice. And enter not into 
judgment with your servant: for 
every one living shall not be justified 
in your sight. For the enemy 
has persecuted my soul: he has humbled 
my life in the earth. He has 
set me in obscure places as the 
dead of the world: and my spirit is in anguish 
upon me, within me 
my heart is troubled. I was mindful 
of old days, I have meditated 

/next/ #Fol. 69v
in all your works: in the 
deeds of your hands did I 
meditate. I have stretched forth my hands to 
you: my soul as earth without 
water unto you. Hear me quickly 
O Lord: my spirit has fainted. Turn not 
away your face from me: and I shall 
be like to them that descend into the lake.
Make me hear your mercy 
in the morning: for I have hoped 
in you. Make the way known to me, 
wherein I may walk: because I have lifted up 
my soul to you. Deliver me from 
my enemies, O Lord, to you 
I have fled: teach me to do your 
will, because you are my God.
Your good spirit shall conduct 
me into the right land: for 

/next/ #Fol. 70r
your name's sake O Lord you shall 
quicken me in your equity. You shall bring 
my soul out of tribulation: 
and in your mercy you shall destroy all 
my enemies. And you shall destroy all, 
that afflict my soul: because 
I am your servant. Litany:

doth bind. Through Christ. Prayer:

and redeemer of all the faithful, 
give unto the souls

which they have always wished for.
Rest in peace. Amen.

Beginning of the Office of the Dead. 
Antiphon: I will please. Psalm of David:
I have loved, because 
our Lord: will hear the voice of my prayer.
Because he has inclined 
his ear 
to me: and in my days I will call 
upon him. The sorrows of death have compassed 
me: and the pains of hell have 
found me. I have found tribulation, and 
sorrow: and I called on the name 
of our Lord. O Lord, deliver my soul, 
merciful Lord, and just: 
and our God has mercy. Our Lord 
keeps little ones: I was humbled, 
and he has delivered me. Turn 
O my soul into your rest: 

/next/ #Fol. 75v
because our Lord hath done good to you. Because 
he has delivered my soul from death: my eyes 
from tears, my feet 
from sliding. I will please our Lord in the 
country of the living. Eternal rest 
give unto them O Lord: and let perpetual light 
shine unto them. Antiphon: I will please the Lord 
in the country of the living. Antiphon: Woe is me.
When I was in tribulation. Antiphon:
Woe is me O Lord, that my abode 
is prolonged. Antiphon: Our Lord. Psalm:
I have lifted up my eyes. Antiphon: Our Lord 
does keep you from all evil, our Lord 
can keep your soul. Antiphon: If.  Psalm:
From the depths I have cried. Antiphon: If
you O Lord observe iniquities, 
O Lord who shall be able to endure it? Antiphon:
The works of your hands. Psalm:

/next/ #Fol. 76r
I will confess to you O Lord in 
my whole heart: because you have heard all the
words of my mouth. In the sight of angels 
I will sing to you: I will adore toward 
your holy temple, and will 
confess to your name. Upon your mercy 
and your truth: because you have magnified 
your holy name above all things.
In what day soever I shall 
call on you, hear me: you shall multiply 
strength in my soul.
Let all the kings of the earth O Lord 
confess to you: because they have heard all 
the words of your mouth. And let them sing in 
the ways of our Lord: because great is the glory of our Lord.
Because our Lord is high, and he beholds
low things: and high things 
he knows far off. If I shall walk in 

/next/ #Fol. 76v
the midst of tribulation, you will quicken 
me: and upon the wrath of my enemies 
you have extended your hand, 
and your right hand has saved me.
Our Lord will repay for me, O Lord 
your mercy is forever: despise not the works 
of your hands.
Eternal rest. Antiphon: The works of your hands 
dispise not O Lord. Verse: 
I heard a voice from heaven saying 
unto me. Blessed are the dead which 
die in our Lord. Antiphon: All.
My soul: does magnify our Lord.
Eternal rest. Antiphon: All,
that my Father gives me, shall come 
unto me, and he that comes unto me, 
I will not cast forth. Our Father.
And lead us not. But deliver. Psalm:

/next/ #Fol. 77r
My soul praise you our Lord, 
I will praise our Lord in my life: 
I will sing to my God as long as I shall 
be. Put not confidence in princes: 
in the children of men, in whom 
there is no salvation. His spirit shall 
go forth, and shall return into his earth: 
in that day all their 
cogitations shall perish. Blessed 
is he whose God of Jacob is his helper his hope 
in our Lord his God: which 
made heaven and earth, the sea, and all 
things that are in them. Which keeps 
truth forever, does 
judgment for them that suffer wrong, 
gives food to the hungry. Our Lord 
loses the fettered: our Lord lightens 
the blind. Our Lord lifts up 

/next/ #Fol. 77v
the bruised: our Lord loveth the just. Our Lord 
keeps strangers, the 
fatherless and widow he will receive: 
and the ways of sinners he shall destroy.
Our Lord shall reign forever, your God 
O Sion: in generation and ge-
neration. Eternal rest. 
Antiphon: From the gate of hell. Deliver their souls 
O Lord. O Lord hear. Prayer:
Incline your ear 
to our petitions, O Lord, 
by which we humbly implore your mercy: 
that the soul of your servant,
which you have commanded 
to depart, may be received by you 
in a country of peace and light,
and admitted to the company of your saints. Prayer:
O God the creator, and redeemer of all the faithful. In

/next/ #Fol. 78r
the beginning of the nocturne. Antiphon: Direct. Psalm:
Receive O Lord my words 
with your ears: understand my 
cry. Attend to the voice of my 
prayer: my King, and my God. Because 
I will pray to you O Lord: in the morning you will 
hear my voice. In the morning 
I will stand by you, and will see: because you are 
a God that will not be iniquity.
Neither shall the malignant dwell 
by you: neither shall the unjust abide 
before your eyes. You hate all, 
that work iniquity: you shall destroy 
all, that speak lies.
The bloody man, and deceitful 
our Lord will abhor: but I 
in the multitude of your mercy.
I will enter into your house: 

/next/ #Fol. 78v
I will adore towards your holy temple 
in your fear. Lord conduct 
me in your justice because of 
mine enemies: direct my way 
in your sight. Because there is no 
truth in their mouth: their heart 
is vain. Their throat 
is an open sepulcher: they dealt deceitfully 
with their tongues, judge them O 
God. Let them fail of their cogitations, 
according to the multitude 
of their impieties expel them: because 
they have provoked you O Lord. And let 
all be glad, that hope in you: 
they shall rejoice forever, and you shall 
dwell in them. And all that love 
your name, shall glory in 
you: because you will bless the just.
Lord as with a shield, of thy good will: thou hast crowned us.

/next/ #Fol. 79r
Lord as with a shield, of you good 
will: you have crowned us. Eternal
rest. Antiphon: Direct O Lord God
my way in your sight.
Antiphon: Turn you. Psalm:
Lord rebuke me not in your fury. Antiphon: 
Turn you O Lord, and deliver my 
soul: because there is not in death, that 
is mindful of you. Antiphon: Lest peradventure. Psalm: 
O Lord my God I have hoped in 
you: save me from all that 
persecutes me, and 
deliver me. Lest sometimes he as 
a lion violently take my soul: whilst there is none 
to redeem nor to save.
O Lord my God if I have done 
this: if there be iniquity in my hands.
If I have rendered 

/next/ #Fol. 79v
to me that repaid me evils: let me worthily fall 
empty from mine enemies. Let the enemy persecute 
my soul, and take 
it, and tread down my life in the earth: 
and bring down my glory 
into dust. Arise 
Lord in thy wrath: and be exalted in 
the coasts of thine enemies.
And arise O Lord my God 
in the precept, which you have commanded: 
and a synagogue of peoples shall 
compass you. And for it return 
on high: our Lord judges 
peoples. Judge me O Lord 
according to my justice: and according 
to mine innocence 
upon me. The wickedness 
of sinners shall be consumed, and you shall direct the just: 

/next/ #Fol. 80r
which searches the hearts and reins O God.
My just help is 
from our Lord: who saves those that be right 
of heart. God is a just judge, strong 
and patient: is he angry 
every day? Unless you will be 
converted, he has shaken his sword: 
he has bent his bow, and prepared 
it. And in it he has prepared the instruments 
of death: he has made his arrows 
for them that burn. Behold he travails with injustice, 
he has conceived sorrow: and brought forth 
iniquity. He has opened a pit, 
and digged it up: and he has fallen 
into the ditch, which he made. His sorrow 
shall be turned upon his head: 
and his iniquity shall descend 
upon his crown. I will con-

/next/ #Fol. 80v
fess to our Lord according to his justice: 
and will sing to the name of our Lord 
most high. Eternal rest. Antiphon: Lest 
peradventure he may catch my soul as a lion, 
whilst there is none which may redeem it, or 
which may save it. Verse: From the gates 
of hell. Deliver O Lord their souls.
Our Father. First lesson:
Spare me O Lord for 
my days are nothing. What is man, 
that you magnifies him: or why 
set you your heart toward him? 
You do visit him early in the morning, and suddenly 
you prove him. How long do you not spare 
me, nor suffer me, that I swallow 
my spittle? I have sinned. What shall 
I do to you, O keeper of men? Why 
have you set me contrary to you, and 

/next/ #Fol. 81r
I have become burdensome to myself? 
Why do you not take away my sin, 
and why do you not take away mine 
iniquity? Behold now I shall sleep in the 
dust, and if you seek me in the morning, I shall 
not be. Response: I believe that my redeemer 
lives, and that in the last day 
I shall rise from the earth: and 
in my flesh shall see God 
my savior. Verse: Whom I myself 
shall see and not another, and mine eyes 
shall behold. And in my flesh.
My soul is weary Second lesson
of my life, I will let my speech 
pass against myself. I will 
speak in the bitterness of my 
soul: I will say to God condemn me not. 
Shew me why you judges me so? 

/next/ #Fol. 81v
Does it seem good to you, 
if you calumniate me, and oppress 
me, the work of your hands, and 
help the counsel of the impious? Have 
you eyes of flesh: or 
as a man sees, shall you also see? 
Are your days as the days of a man, 
and are your years as the times of men, 
that you should seek my 
iniquity, and should search my 
sin? And should know that I have done 
no impious thing, whereas there is no man, 
that can deliver out of your hand.

Response: You which did raise Lazarus stinking 
from the grave: You O Lord give 
them rest, and place of 
Pardon. Verse: Which are to come to judge 
the living, and the dead, and the world by fire. 

/next/ #Fol. 82r
You O Lord. Third lesson.
Your hands O Lord have made 
me, and framed me wholly 
round about: and do you so suddenly cast 
me down headlong? Remember, I beseech you, that 
as clay you made me, and into dust 
you will bring me again. Have you not 
as milk milked me, and curded me 
as cheese? With skin, and flesh 
you have clothed me: with bones, and sinews 
you have compacted me. Life and mercy 
you have given me, and your visitation 
has kept my spirit. Response: 
Deliver me Lord, from eternal death,
on the fearful day, when 
the heavens and the earth shall be moved: when
You shall come to judge the world by
fire. Verse: That day, day of wrath, cala-

/next/ #Fol. 82v
mity and misery, day of great and 
exceeding bitterness. When you shall come 
to judge the world by fire. Verse: Eternal 
rest give unto them O Lord: and 
let perpetual light shine unto them. Deliver me.
When you shall come. Antiphon: They shall rejoice. Psalm:
Have mercy on me, O God, according. Antiphon: 
The bones that have been humbled shall 
rejoice. Antiphon: Hear, O God, my prayer. 
A hymn, O God, becomes you in Sion: 
and a vow shall be paid to thee in 
Jerusalem. Hear, O God, 
my prayer: all flesh shall come to you.
The words of the wicked have prevailed 
over us: and you will pardon 
our transgressions. Blessed is he 
whom you have chosen and taken to you: he shall dwell 
in your courts. We shall be 

/next/ #Fol. 83r
filled with the good things of your house; holy 
is your temple, wonderful in 
justice. Hear us, O God 
our saviour, who are the hope of all the ends 
of the earth, and in the sea afar off. You who prepares 
the mountains by your strength, being girded 
with power: who troubles the depth 
of the sea, the noise of its 
waves. The Gentiles shall be 
troubled, and they that dwell in the uttermost borders 
shall be afraid at your signs: you shall make the outgoings of the morning and 
of the evening to be joyful. You have visited the 
earth, and have plentifully watered it; you have many 
ways enriched it. The river 
of God is filled with water, you have 
prepared their food: for so is its prepa-
ration. Fill up plentifully the streams thereof, 
multiply its fruits; it 

/next/ #Fol. 83v
shall spring up and rejoice in its showers.
You shall bless the crown of the year 
of your goodness: and your fields shall be filled 
with plenty. The beautiful places of the wilderness 
shall grow fat: and the hills shall be girded about 
with joy. The rams of the flock are 
clothed, and the vales shall abound with corn: 
they shall sing a hymn. Eternal 
rest. Antiphon: Hear, O God, my prayer: 
all flesh shall come to you.
Antiphon: Has received me. Psalm: O God my God.
God have mercy upon us. Antiphon:
Your right hand has received me.
Antiphon: From the gates of hell. Psalm: 
I have said in the midst of my days, 
shall I go to the gates of 
Hell. I have sought the residue of my years: 
I have said, I shall not see our Lord 

/next/ #Fol. 84r
God in the land of the living. I shall 
behold man no more: and the inhabiter 
of rest. My generation 
is taken away: and is wrapped up 
from me as the tents of shepherds.
My life is cut off as 
by a weaver, while I yet began, 
he cut me off: from morning unto night 
you will make an end of me. I hope 
even until the morning: as a lion so has he 
broken all my bones. From morning, 
until evening you will make an end of me: 
as a young swallow, so 
will I cry, I will meditate as a dove.
Mine eyes are weakened: looking up 
on high. Lord I suffer 
violence, answer for me: what shall I say 
or what shall he answer me, whereas 

/next/ #Fol. 84v
myself have done it? I will recount all 
my years: in the bitterness of my 
soul. Lord if man's life be such, and 
the life of my spirit in such things, you shall chasten me, 
and shall quicken me: behold in peace 
is my bitterness most bitter. But you 
have delivered my soul that 
it should not perish: you have cast all my sins 
behind your back. Because 
hell shall not confess to you, 
neither shall death praise you: they that go down 
into the lake, 
shall not expect your truth. The living, the living 
he shall confess to you, as 
I also this day: the father to the children shall make 
your truth known. O Lord save 
me: and we will sing our Psalms 
all the days of our life, 

/next/ #Fol. 85r
in the house of our Lord. Eternal
rest. Antiphon: From the gate of hell deliver 
my soul O Lord. Antiphon: Let every spirit.
Praise ye our Lord from the heavens. Psalm of David:
Sing ye to our Lord a new song. Psalm:
Praise ye our Lord in his saints. Antiphon: Let every 
spirit praise our Lord. Verse: I heard 
a voice from heaven saying unto me.
Blessed are the dead that die in Our 
Lord. Antiphon: I am. Psalm:
Blessed be our Lord God of Israel. Antiphon: 
I am the resurrection and the life: he which 
believes in me, although he 
was dead, yet shall he live: and everyone which 
lives, and believes in me, shall not die 
forever. Our Father. And lead us not. Psalm:
From the depths. Antiphon: From the gates of hell. 
Deliver their souls O Lord. O Lord hear.

ar [sic]. And let my cry. Let us pray. Prayer:
May the souls of all the faithful departed
be part of the holy 
resurrection, and deserve to live
in heaven by you Jesus
Christ, savior of the world, who with 
the Father and the Holy Spirit, who [sic] lives 
and reigns, God, forever and 
ever. Amen.
